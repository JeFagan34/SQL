# James Fagan's SQL Portfolio

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This collection showcases various SQL projects I've worked on to demonstrate my skills and expertise in database management, querying, and analysis. Each project is designed to highlight different aspects of SQL, from basic querying to more complex data manipulations and optimizations. If you have any questions, please email me at jefagan34@gmail.com. You can also learn more about me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimfagan34/.
